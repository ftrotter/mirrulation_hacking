# Mirrulation Data Hacking
some useful things that I like to have for my simple python projects

* the schema to the database is db.sql
* the json extract tool is import_json.py
   * To run it, put your database credentials into a .env file and put the .env file in the main directory
   * And then copy the .env file to the /trottertools/mySQLh/ directory
* the tool to hit the ChatGPT etc api is ask_ChatGPT.py
* there is a copy of the recent DEA extract available under /data/ if you want to look at the results
